I decided to major in MIS because I believe that it will further my career in business. As the society continues to evolve and become more advanced, technology has been and will become the primary contributor to these changes. In addition to my BBA in Finance and Management, pursuing a degree in MIS will give me a competitive edge to help organizations analyze their financials and identify problems in their decision-making process. I also chose this major because I wanted to step out of my comfort zone and get hands-on experience with coding.
